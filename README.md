For this project I had to make a webpage for the fictional company Square Eyes - a website where you can buy and then stream those movies.

## Description

This was my very first project at Noroff. The project started as a design project where we only used Figma. Later we were tasked to build it as a website with HTML and CSS, and at a later date we added JavaScript and Wordpress as a headless CMS as well. 

## Brief

A video streaming website where you can purchase high-quality videos directly from the people who make them. The users of this website want to purchase videos right away, which will allow them to watch it online.

### Target audience
Aged 25 to 40 and are interested in cinema. They enjoy watching interesting and high-quality films.

### Unique selling points
Content watchers: Supporting small filmmakers and discovering interesting films.

### Site architecture
- Home
- List of Videos
- A video page showing the product details (product details such as the description of the product, price and add to cart button)
- A checkout page
- A checkout success
- About
- Contact

## Built With
