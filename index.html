    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
        I would advise my client to never blindly trust data from the browser. They should assume the worst as it is better to be safe than sorry. 
        
        </p>Sanitization of data: an attacker can recover media that is not really erased because it is in storage. Data sanitization therefore means that the media will be permanently deleted from storage to ensure that it cannot be recovered. This can be done manually or by using a third-party solution. </p>
        
        </p>Secure authorization and authentication: are two vital information security processes that administrators use to protect systems and information, which is why one should make them very hard to crack. This can also be done manually or by using an open-standard authorization protocol or framework.</p>
        
        </p>Make use of a well-known third-party application: which involves said party to be trusted and tested. Here you should do research beforehand and check how many downloads the applications get per week to see which one to choose. </p>
        
        </p>Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration: This is a process that will catch any oversight on the developers side and then help maintain the reliability of the changes to a codebase. </p>
        
        </p>Network secutiry: is the act of protecting the exchange of packets of data across the network. As the front-end developer I must be wary of what network to connect to and where to host the website. </p>
        
        </p>Implementation of automatic user tomeout: is about setting an expiration of the user credentials to protect the users when they leave their credentials hanging in the browser for a long time. </p>
